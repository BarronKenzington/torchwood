# 8 Social Media Accounts Every Small Business Owner Should Follow

Social media is full of "gurus" promising the world but delivering generic advice. For small business owners, finding accounts that actually provide value can feel impossible.

## How to Actually Use These Accounts

Following isn't enough. Here's how to get value:

### 1. Create a Separate List

Don't let these accounts get lost in your feed. Create a dedicated list or folder so you can check them regularly.

### 2. Take Notes

When you see something valuable, save it. Use:
- Screenshots
- Notes app
- Bookmarking tools
- Your task management system

### 3. Implement, Don't Just Consume

Pick one idea per week and implement it. Knowledge without action is just entertainment.

### 4. Engage Thoughtfully

Comment with questions or insights. Engagement helps you remember content and sometimes leads to valuable connections.

### 5. Set Time Limits

Social media can be a time sink. Set a limit (15-30 minutes per day) and stick to it.

## What to Avoid

### Hype Accounts

Avoid accounts that:
- Promise instant results
- Use excessive hype and urgency
- Focus on motivation without practical steps
- Constantly sell courses or programs

### Comparison Trap

Don't compare your beginning to someone else's middle. Everyone's journey is different.

### Consumption Without Action

Following accounts isn't productive if you never implement what you learn. Limit consumption, maximize action.

## Making Social Media Work for You

Social media can be a valuable learning tool when used strategically:

- **Follow selectively:** Quality over quantity
- **Engage meaningfully:** Comment and discuss, don't just scroll
- **Implement regularly:** Put ideas into practice
- **Set boundaries:** Limit time and protect your focus

## Beyond Social Media

While these accounts are valuable, don't rely solely on social media for business education:

- Read books (many of these creators have written excellent ones)
- Join communities (masterminds, forums, local groups)
- Take courses (when relevant to your needs)
- Work with mentors or coaches
- Learn by doing (experiment and iterate)

## The Bottom Line

Social media can be a powerful learning tool when you follow the right accounts and use them strategically. These 8 accounts consistently deliver value—but only if you implement what you learn.

Start with 2-3 accounts, engage regularly, and implement one idea per week. That's how you turn social media into a business-building tool.
